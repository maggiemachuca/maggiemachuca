# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maggiemachuca/">Maggie Machuca</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

I'm passionate about IT and Cybersecurity and thrive on solving real-world challenges through hands-on, technical projects. I enjoy diving into the evolving security landscape and finding ways to strengthen systems and processes.

My portfolio showcases a range of IT and security projects: from infrastructure setup, ticketing workflows, to front-end tools that visualize core networking concepts. These projects reflect my commitment to learning, as well as my drive to enhance security operations through practical experience.

I'm also actively building my knowledge through industry-recognized certifications. Below, you'll find both completed certifications and those I’m currently pursuing.
